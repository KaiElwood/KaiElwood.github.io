        <h3 class="caption">Overview:</h3>
        <p class="bodytext">For this project, I wanted to make a very basic instrument that would play different chords depending on where your mouse was on the screen. I envisioned it as a method to bring an interactive aspect to a music artist's website, or a tool to come up with basic chord progressions. </p>

        <h3 class="caption">Goals:</h3>
        <p class="bodytext">Inspire users to make different chord progressions based on their own explorations within the musical framework provided. </p>

        <h3 class="caption">Design Choices and Interface:</h3>
        <p class="bodytext">I tried to accomplish my goal by creating different squares without explicitly explaining which square represented which chord, in order for the user to explore.
        In addition, I chose to use chords instead of drums because I wanted to give the user more melodic freedom beyond what purely drums would allow. The sounds were created in Logic Pro X, with a little verb added via Vahalla (Vintage Verb).
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
        The code works by playing a different Markov chain on each 4th of the provided screen. Hover over different parts of the screen to try it!
        </p>

        <h3 class="caption">Future Revision/Opportunities to Improve:</h3>
        <p class="bodytext">Ideally, I wanted this to be the background to a website. However, when I tried to implement it into an HTML file, I ran into trouble due to Chrome not allowing my computer to create sound. In the future I’d like to learn how to successfully put a p5 file into an HTML document in order to give users the full experience I desired. In addition, I’d like to add other sounds such as a base and drums in order to allow the user to create a loop and add additional sounds.</p>
